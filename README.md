# inVcycle
Code for reproducing results in P. Vacek, E. C. Carson and K. M. Soodhalter, The effect of approximate coarsest-level solves on the convergence of multigrid V-cycle methods, https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06182 .
MATLAB R2023a is used.

* **experiments/inVcycleCGVariousRelativeResidualTolerances.m**: generates data included in Figures 1 and 8 of the paper.
* **experiments/inVcycleCGRelativeCoarsestLevelAccuracy.m**: generates data included in Figures 2 and 3 of the paper.
* **experiments/inVcycleCGTestRelativeResidualEstimate.m**: generates data included in Figure 4 of the paper.
* **experiments/inVcycleCGAbsoluteCoarsestLevelAccuracy.m**: generates data included in Figure5 of the paper.
* **experiments/inVcycleCGAbsoluteCoarsestLevelStoppingCriteria.m**: generates data included in Figures 6 of the paper.
* **experiments/inVcycleCGTestPerformanceAbsoluteCoarsestLevelStrategy.m**: generates data included in Figures 7 and 8 of the paper.


The script **experiments/inVcycleCGTestRelativeResidualEstimate.m** requires the [Advanpix Multiprecision Computing Toolbox](https://www.advanpix.com/) for MATLAB, we used version 5.1.0.15432.

## Matrices
The system matrices were generated by the FE software [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) (version 2019.1.0), see **matrixGeneration/assembleMatricesFenics.py** . This script requires python libraries [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [petsc4py](https://pypi.org/project/petsc4py/). The resulting data were further pre-processed by **matrixGeneration/saveFenicsMatricesAsMatrixHierarchy.m**.
